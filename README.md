# A Globalization Dashboard
### Final project for Introduction to Data Science by Federico Mammana, Francesco Danovi & Milan Schröder (Hertie School)

We aim to fill a gap in research resources: 
Currently, there is only one curated Index of Globality (i.e., the level of Globalization) available to researchers interested in a measurement of globalization as a multidimensional phenomenon beyond its pure economic dimension – the KOF Globalisation Index (Dreher et al. 2008; Gygli et al. 2018).
This index, however, applies a “flexible definition” (Gygli et al. 2018), operationalizing globalization as a catch-all-term that incorporates theoretically distinct concepts (e.g., cross-border interaction, integration, interdependence) in a complex but rather arbitrary fashion (see Kessler 2016; Schröder 2020). Indicators of these concepts yield empirically strongly differential results. The KOF’s dominance seems to originate less from its validity than its availability.

To provide an alternative to scholars interested in a more valid measure, we plan to construct an updated version of the Kessler Globality Index (Kessler 2016), that was only constructed for a single year yet. The KGI follows the contrary approach to the KOF, focussing on a clear definition, the strong validity of its indicators, and simple replicability. 

This makes it feasible to construct the KGI for a wide range of countries over a period of at least 20 years, using data available via APIs mostly. With approval of the author, we will include some minor updates and present the data as an interactive dashboard.
